PairProgrammingCodeLab
======================

The purpose of this project is to help build a body of empirical evidence around whether initial development is in fact faster singly or using pair programming techniques.

Before proceeding, decide whether you are going to complete the exercise by yourself or with a pair.  Develop the solution in whatever language you feel most comfortable--the problem is designed to be platform agnostic.
Once you complete the problem, please complete the brief survey that is included in this repository so we can get a better feeling for the outcome.

LCD Numbers

Please write a program that takes a number and returns the ascii text version of a LCD display.

For example, for input:
	
	
	0123

Your program should output:
	
	 _       _   _  
	| |   |  _|  _|
	|_|   | |_   _|
	
For reference, the full set of LCD digits is:
	
	 _       _   _       _       _   _   _ 
	| |   |  _|  _| |_| |_  |_    | |_| |_|
	|_|   | |_   _|   |  _| |_|   | |_|  _|
